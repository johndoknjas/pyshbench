"stockfish" is stockfish binary on master (June 17)
Binaries with "branch-1" suffix are my commits on the "speed-optimizations" branch:
E.g., "my-stockfish-834b21e" is my stockfish at this commit (first commit on branch, with all changes).

"my-stockfish" is binary of commit eedd5 in "branch-prediction-2". If benchmarking now goes well, I'll open a fishtest for it.
