Just replace the current "stockfish" binary with whatever the current master's binary is, and replace "my-stockfish" with
the binary of your branch that you want to test. Then run with "python3 pyshbench.py a b 50". a and b can be anything, don't affect
program's run due to your changes to the code (other than what it calls the two SF versions when outputting final results). The 50 in the example
here is if you wanted to run 50 trials.

Was useful solving bug I had before:
